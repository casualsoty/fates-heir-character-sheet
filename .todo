A) A dice icon somewhere that just rolls a d100 without a modifier but idk where on the sheet there is a nice spot for that.. maybe the butterfly at the top? but that would be crazy
B) I think we can remove "backpacks" from the inventory tab
C) Fonts on the 2 additional pages
D) On the Spellcasting sheet, turn the "Casting Stat" into Powers than are linked on sheet 1 (but thats like impossible idk?)
E) Remove DC, Action, Bonus Action, Reaction, Conc., Ritual, Prepared, Spell School, Cantrips, Spell Usage, Targets (basically make it an copy paste-empty thing, but we will have to test how that reacts in case someone imports a spell for a category that doesnt exist)

A) All the DnD lingo (aka DC, Action/Bonus action, spell useage, spell level) was gone
B) If they could press it and it rolls either with A) a single power * level * 5 or if they can fuse multiple powers with B) all powers * all levels * 5
